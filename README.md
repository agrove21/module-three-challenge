## Description
I modified starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
-   Added a series of prompts to the "Add Employee" button
-   Inputted multiple employees.
-   After adding all employees, added a prompted to continue or cancel.
-   After selecting cancel, employee data is displayed on the page.

Also, I learned about loops in JavaScript.
